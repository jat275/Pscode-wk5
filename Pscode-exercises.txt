// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers a+b=c
   num1 + num2 = sum
   print sum
   ask for 2 numbers
   add the 2 number together
   print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers
   // Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
   input whole number
   divide number by 2
   if divided number has a decimal that does not equal 0 then it is odd
   print even or odd depending on result
   // Exercise 3:
   Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
   a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
   b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five
   entered numbers.
   d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message
   describing what they are

      input 5 numbers (num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
      determine the average by adding all numbers then dividing by 5
         (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5 = avg
      calculate the minimum 
      min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5) = minNum
      calculate the maximum
      max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5) = maxNum
      print 'the average of the five numbers is:' avg
      print 'The minimum number is:' minNum
      print 'The maximum number is:' maxNum
